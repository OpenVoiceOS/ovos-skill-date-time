# Date and Time
Get the time, date, day of the week

## About 
Get the local time or time for major cities around the world.  Times
are given in 12-hour (2:30 pm) or 24-hour format (14:30) based on the
Time Format setting at your [mycroft.conf](https://github.com/OpenVoiceOS/ovos-config/blob/dev/ovos_config/mycroft.conf#L33):

```json
{
  // Time format, either 'half' (e.g. "11:37 pm") or 'full' (e.g. "23:37")
  "time_format": "half",

  // Date format, either 'MDY' (e.g. "11-29-1978") or 'DMY' (e.g. "29-11-1978")
  "date_format": "MDY",
}
```
